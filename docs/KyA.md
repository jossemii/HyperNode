# Know Your Assumptions (KyA) for **Nodo**

**Nodo** is P2P software that follows the [CELAUT](https://github.com/celaut-project/paradigm) paradigm, allowing nodes to offer and request services. All transactions and service remunerations are conducted on the Ergo network, which is based on blockchain technology.

## By accepting this KyA, you acknowledge and agree that:

1. The use of **Nodo** is at your own risk.
2. You are solely responsible for your assets and decisions within the network.
3. Services offered and requested in **Nodo** are remunerated through Ergo, and all transactions are final and irreversible.

## Please note that:

- **Alpha Version**: **Nodo** is in its alpha phase, meaning there may be bugs and issues. Full functionality and security of the software are not guaranteed.
- **Payment System**: All transactions are processed via the Ergo platform, and each can be viewed through the Ergo explorer.
- **Reputation System**: Nodes generate reputation proofs stored on the Ergo platform. These proofs influence the level of trust within the network.
- **Donation Models**: Nodes can choose to donate a portion of their earnings to a specified address in the `ERGO_DONATION_WALLET` environment variable, with the default value being 0.
- **Alternative Payments**: Although Ergo is currently used for transactions, other payment systems may be integrated into **Nodo** in the future.

**Nodo** developers cannot offer assistance in cases of asset loss, hacking, or theft of private keys.

**Check how and why Nodo uses [Ergo](ERGO.md).**
